# PHP - Pricecaclulating Heroes Present!
This is a challenge that Glenn and I will tackle on together.
We need to apply basic OOP principles, import data with a database, and learn to use an MVC.
Calling this challenge a real challenge would be an understatement.

## The First Step
We decided that we'll start out by reading up on MVC's, skimming through the boilerplate code we received, and just try to make sense of it all.
The coaches have also given us a small to-do list to help us get started.

- [x] explore what is mvc ? why is everything a class? send help plz
- [x] make DB
- [ ] make connection between controller/model and DB
- [ ] display data to test connection
- [ ] DO IT ALL ON HOMEPAGE FOR TESTING REFACTOR LATER

Our current major goal is to be able to make a connection between the controller/model and the database.
Once we have a way better understanding of this exercise, we will be able to create a more concrete TO-DO list.
And with that TO-DO list, we will be able to create a working price-calculating website that we can both be proud of!
